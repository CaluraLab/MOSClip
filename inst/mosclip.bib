	abstract = {Survival analyses of gene expression data has been a useful and widely used approach in clinical applications. But, in complex diseases, such as cancer, the identification of survival-associated cell processes - rather than single genes - provides more informative results because the efficacy of survival prediction increases when multiple prognostic features are combined to enlarge the possibility of having druggable targets. Moreover, genome-wide screening in molecular medicine has rapidly grown, providing not only gene expression but also multi-omic measurements such as {DNA} mutations, methylation, expression, and copy number data. In cancer, virtually all these aberrations can contribute in synergy to pathological processes, and their measurements can improve a patient’s outcome and help in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Here, we present {MOSClip}, an R package implementing a new topological pathway analysis tool able to integrate multi-omic data and look for survival-associated gene modules. {MOSClip} tests the survival association of dimensionality-reduced multi-omic data using multivariate models, providing graphical devices for management, browsing and interpretation of results. Using simulated data we evaluated {MOSClip} performance in terms of false positives and false negatives in different settings, while the {TCGA} ovarian cancer dataset is used as a case study to highlight {MOSClip}’s potential.},
