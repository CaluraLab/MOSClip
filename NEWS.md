# MOSClip 1.0.0

* Initial BioConductor submission.
* New topological pathway analysis tool able to integrate multi-omics data. It 
finds survival-associated gene modules or significant modules for two-class 
analysis. This tool have two main methods: pathway tests and module tests. 
The latter method allows the user to dig inside the pathways itself.
